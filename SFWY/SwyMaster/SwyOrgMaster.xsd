			<xs:documentation>A legally defined business entity. In our business terms these are Safeway Incorporated and its associates such as Canada Safeway Limited,
 and various holding or financial companies.  Independent stores that  our warehouses service are also recorded as corporations.

			<xs:documentation>Division Id is used with a corporation code to uniquely identify a division.
 It is a subset of a corporation that is logically and practically manageable.
Each division supports only one type of business, e.g., it may be retail stores, warehouses, or plants.
It also maintains its own General Ledger. BUSINESS TYPE indicates the type of division, e.g., Retail, Wholesale, Administrative.
 In the U.S., and going forward, the convention has been to use the same division number for retail and wholesale operations (with
 business-type = retail). For instance, when supplying product (i.e. from a warehouse to a store), you have one division that supplies the product (the
 warehouse's division), and one division that receives the product (the store's division). Often the supplying and receiving division are the                                                   same, but in some cases a warehouse may reside in a different division from the store it services.

					<xs:documentation>A four character code that is used with corporation
 and division to uniquely identify a facility. A facility may "belong" to
 only one corporation and one division. A building may house one or more
facilities. There are two categories for facilities:
 1) Operating facility
 - actively supports the business of the Company
 - is a distinct business operation within a building
  - examples: office, processing plant, retail store, truck service
 shop, or warehouse building  (A warehouse facility includes all warehouse departments that exist within a single building.)
 - each type of division/business has a different set of possible types of operating facilities: i.e.,
 - Retail: retail outlets and offices.
- Wholesale: warehouse facilities, truck service shop, and offices.
- Processing/Manufacturing: processing plants and offices.
 2) Non-operating Facility                                                     
 - not currently being operated by the Company.
